# VirtualClassroom

Project Overview

Technologies:

HTML: Used for the structure and content of the web pages.
CSS: Used for styling the web pages and controlling the visual layout.
JavaScript: Used for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to the web pages.
JSP (JavaServer Pages): Used for creating dynamic web pages, handling server-side logic, and interacting with the database.
SQL: Used for database operations (defining the schema, creating tables, inserting data).
SCSS: is a CSS preprocessor used to write CSS faster.
MySQL: Used as the database management system to store user data, course information, and other application data.
Java: as JSP is based on Java, we can say that java is used in this project.
Frameworks/Libraries:

Bootstrap: A CSS framework used for responsive design and styling the user interface.
font awesome: is a library used for the icons.
jquery: is a js library used for DOM manipulations.
Others JS libraries: This project uses multiple js libraries such as: jquery.ajaxchimp.min.js, jquery.barfiller.js, jquery.countdown.min.js, jquery.counterup.min.js, jquery.form.js, jquery.magnific-popup.js, jquery.nice-select.min.js, jquery.paroller.min.js, jquery.slicknav.min.js, jquery.sticky.js, jquery.validate.min.js, jquery.vide.js, gijgo.min.js, owl.carousel.min.js, slick.min.js, wow.min.js, modernizr-3.5.0.min.js, popper.min.js, waypoints.min.js, hover-direction-snake.min.js, animated-headline.js.

The project appears to be a web application for a Virtual Classroom or online learning platform. It includes features for:

Admin Management: Admin login, dashboard, and management of faculty and student requests.
Faculty Management: Faculty login, registration, and likely a dashboard for managing their classes.
Student Management: Student login, registration, and a dashboard for accessing courses and materials.
Course Enrollment: Students can enroll in courses based on their degree and program.
User Authentication: Secure login and registration for all user types.
Database: A MySQL database is used to store user data, course information, and admin credentials.
Frontend: the project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The framework used for styles is bootstrap.
File Analysis

README.md:

Contains a very brief description: "# VirtualClassroom Choose". This confirms the project's purpose.
project_DB.sql:

Database Schema: This SQL file defines the database structure.
Tables:
admin: Stores admin login credentials (password). The password is encrypted using SHA1.
enroll_for: Stores information about available degrees and courses (e.g., B.Sc Computer Application).
student: Stores student information (roll number, name, password, email, degree, course, year, approval status).
faculty: Stores faculty information (name, username, password, email, degree, course, year, subject, approval status).
Data: Insert some basic information on the admin, enroll_for tables.
style.scss:

SCSS Structure: This file is the main SCSS file, importing various other SCSS files that define styles for different parts of the application.
Modular Design: The SCSS is organized into modules for header, slider, about section, team section, courses, login, blog, contact, etc.
theme: Contains a brief description of the theme.
admin_login.jsp:

JSP (JavaServer Pages): This is a Java web page that handles admin login.
Functionality:
Login Form: Presents a password input field for admin login.
Database Interaction: Connects to the MySQL database to verify the entered password against the one stored in the admin table.
Session Management: Uses session attributes (session.setAttribute) to track if an admin is logged in and to store error messages.
Redirection: Redirects to admin_dashboard.jsp if the login is successful.
Error Handling: Displays an "Invalid Password" message if the password is incorrect.
Error: Contains admin_login.jsp as the action for the login form, this is an error.
Dependencies: This file uses bootstrap, fontawesome and other css and js.
Other Files

There are a lot of css, scss, js, jsp and image files.
Key Observations

Technology Stack: The project uses JSP for the server-side, MySQL for the database, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend. Bootstrap is used for styling.
Security: Basic password security is implemented by using SHA1 for password hashing, but it is not the strongest option.
User Roles: The application distinguishes between admin, faculty, and student roles.
Modular Design: The CSS is well-organized into separate SCSS files for different sections.
Dependencies: The projects uses multiple dependencies.
File types: uses multiple file types such as : scss, jsp, sql, css, js, png, svg, eot, ttf, woff.
Potential Improvements

Password Security: Consider using a more secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt.
Form actions: Update the actions of the forms.
Error Handling: More robust error handling would improve the user experience.
Code Comments: Adding more comments throughout the JSP files would improve readability.
Frontend framework: Consider using a frontend framework like React or Vue.js.
